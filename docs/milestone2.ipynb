    "Derivatives play an essential role in many areas of science and engineering such as fluid dynamics, solving ODEs, optimization and - relatedly - machine learning. In general, there exist four main ways of computing derivatives in practice, that is: manual computation (i.e. computing and implementing derivatives by hand), symbolic differentiation (i.e. WolframAlpha or SymPy), numerical differentiation (i.e. finite difference method) and automatic differentiation (AD). Depending on the complexity of the target function, manual differentiation can require significant amounts of time and is often challenging to \"debug\". Symbolic differentiation alleviates this at the expense of potentially bloated/unitutitive expressions. If analytic derivative expressions are not needed, numerical differentiation, that is approximating derivatives through finite differences, could be considered. This, however, can lead to approximation/floating point errors if the step size is chosen inadequately. \n",
    "\n",
    "AD has emerged as a promising way of adressing many of these issues. Though not providing closed form/symbolic expressions, it allows us to compute derivatives with machine precision without introducing large computational overhead. Sparked by recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep neural networks, which use a subclass of AD (i.e. the backpropagation algorithm) in their training phase, AD has shown its potential across a variety of different aplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we have developed a software package implementing thus far a subclass of AD, namely forward mode AD. We aim at making this software intuitive to use, following best practices in terms of relying on the python data model and style guides."

    "Central to automatic differentiation (AD) is use of the chain rule to decompose derivatives into elemtary binary operations (+, -, *, /, **) and unary operations (sin, cos, exp, log, etc.) Using the chain rule allows for two modes of evaluating a derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forward mode AD - the derivative is computed \"bottom up\" (i.e. fixing the independent variable(s), take the derivative of the innermost function first, and then move up taking derivatives of each sub-expression recursively)\n",
    "2. Reverse mode AD - the derivative is computed \"top down\" (i.e. you fix the dependent variable, take the derivative of the outermost function first with respect to its sub-expressions, and then move inwards taking successive derivatives with respect to their inner sub-expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "AD can be generalized to both oridinary and partial derivatives using matrix products of Jacobians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in forward mode AD, we commonly redefine our arithmetic to use dual numbers of the form $x + x'\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a mathematical object not contained in the set of real numbers, with the property $\\epsilon^2 = 0$. This allows us to store the decomposed derivative as a computational graph represented by dual numbers in each node. Despite this abstract implementation, we can still preserve the critical concept of \"duck typing\": as long as our dual numbers act like an input to their function (e.g. they can be added, multiplied, etc.) then the function will work."

    "Our current implementation of Automatic Differentiation uses Dual Numbers to compute the derivative of a scalar function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. While this suffices for most use cases, we will extend our package to support multivariate vector functions $f: \\mathbb{R}^m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$. However, as the input dimension grows increasingly large, using the forward mode variant of AD becomes inefficient as the number of passes grows proportionate to the number of inputs. Accordingly, in order to acccommodate multiple inputs while accounting for efficiency, we will also implement reverse mode for multivariate functions, which bounds the number of forward passes to one but now requires the storage of all intermediate operations as variable-nodes in a computational graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse mode implementation of AD relies on a directed computational graph represented as a set of instantiated `Node` objects. Each instance of the `Node` class will store, upon initialization, \n",
    "1. `children` - an array of children nodes, used to accumulate the current node's adjoint\n",
    "2. `val` - the function's value evaluated at this step in the computation\n",
    "3. `partials`- an array of the node's local partial derivatives with respect to the parent(s) of the node\n",
    "3. `adjoint` - the function's partial derivative with respect to the current node, initialized as 0 until a reverse pass is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a digraph data structure will allow us to traverse through each intermediate operation in a single forward pass to evaluate the function and compute the partials. Performing a single reverse pass by recursively traversing through each node and its children and using the local partials to build up the adjoints will compute the partial for each input variable and thus the function's gradient. In order to perform a forward pass on the digraph, we will need to extend the operator overloads for `DualNumber` to the `Node` class, making modifications as necessary. While the `val` and `partials` attributes will be computed similarly to `real` and `dual` in the current `DualNumber` class, we will need to extend the operator overloads for `Node` to account for the next intermediate operations, represented as the children of a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if time allows, with a computational graph constructed via the implemented `Node` class, we aim to provide functionality for drawing the computational graph using the `NetworkX` Python package. "

    "### Milestone 1 Feedback (some of which no longer applies)\n",
    "- Background\n",
    "    - We explained the difference between forward and reverse node as computing the derivative \"bottom up\" and \"top down\" rather than \"from the inside out\" and \"from the outside in\", given the intuition that expressions can be thought of as syntax trees.\n",
    "    - We clarified that $\\epsilon$ is a mathematical object not contained in the set of real numbers, to clarify what we had previously described as an \"abstract number\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- How To Use\n",
    "    - Summarized usage in a code snippet.\n",
    "    - Changed how you initialized variables as nodes, removing the need for providing a name to the node (which could conflict across variables): i.e. before you initialized as follows `x1 = Node(\"x1\")`, now it is just `x1 = Node()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software Organization\n",
    "    - Added a note that we may need more modules in `ad39_package` as the project grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation\n",
    "    - Removed `node.child` from our implementation of the `Node` class following feedback that \"as long as each node keeps reference of its parent(s), you can access the whole graph with the output nodes as a handle.\" Also removed `node.name` as per earlier feedback - this is no longer necessary, and if we ever need to give a unique ID to nodes, it will be done entirely on the backend.\n",
    "    - Removed the unintuitive `ForwardMode` class, and instead defined an `AD` class, which now includes: (1) a new `forward_mode` method, (2) the `grad` method (moved from the `Node` class to here, but no longer a static method), and (3) any other methods that will be included in our extension, e.g. `draw` for drawing the computational graph. Note, that the `AD` class object is initialized with the function on which AD will be performed, and we may use a further `Tree` class (or just a list of `Node` objects) under the hood to store the nodes created during the computation."
