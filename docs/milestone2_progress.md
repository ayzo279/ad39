# Milestone 2 Progress Report
## Task Assignments
### Andy
- begin working on Node Class
- complete operator overloading for elementary and trig functions in Node
### Ben
- construct initial AD class with support for Dual Numbers or Nodes
- implement pseudocode for `forward_mode`
- complete `grad` function for AD Class
### Philipp
- construct a Dual Number Class
- complete operator overloading for elementary and trig functions in Dual Number Class
### Overall Team
- meet to finalize implementation of `forward_mode` via Dual Numbers by Milestone 2 and potentially via Nodes for Final Milestone extensions. 
## Current Progress
- revised project outline based on feedback received from Milestone 1
- coordinated implementation roadmap for both Forward Mode via Dual Numbers and Nodes in preparation for possible extensions
- brainstormed possible extensions, including Reverse Mode and drawing a computational graph for different AD modes
